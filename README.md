# Multi-Layer Neural Network Visualizer

This project is an interactive Python GUI application for visualizing, configuring, and training multi-layer neural networks. It allows users to experiment with various architectures, activation functions, loss functions, and datasets, providing real-time feedback through graphical network diagrams and loss/activation plots.

## Features

- Visualize neural network architectures (input, hidden, output layers)
- Customize number of hidden layers and activation functions
- Choose from multiple datasets (XOR, AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XNOR, Circles, Moons, Iris, Iris-3class, custom, or CSV import)
- Select loss functions: RMSE, Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE), or Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE)
- Real-time training animation and manual epoch stepping
- Live plots of loss over epochs and activation functions (with derivatives)
- Test network accuracy and view predictions
- GUI controls for architecture, training parameters, and dataset selection

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- tkinter (usually included with Python)

### Install dependencies (if needed):

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```
